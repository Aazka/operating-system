In this folder you will find "problem_a.c", "problem_b.c", "problem_c.c" and Makefile
to compile these three files you just have to enter "make" command in same directory.

problem_a, problem_b, problem_c:
	you can execute all those types of commands which are required in the respective questions

problem_c:
	commands having "<", ">" and "|" required a space before and after otherwise it will not work properly
	Note: I haven't cator those cases which uses both redirection and pipes in same command

You can exit shell using "exit" or "ctrl+D"
